AppDep - version 2.0

AppDep.exe is a tool you can use to append dependencies at the end of a file.
It searches the demarcation line (being a given one or the default one) in the
target file (supposed to be a makefile). If it is found, all following data are
erased. If it is not, it is appended at end of file. Next all data received on
standard input are appended (those are supposed to be dependencies, as gcc
could generate them for instance).

makefile which requires it, or within any folder in the list the environment
variable PATH contains.
